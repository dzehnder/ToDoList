# ToDoList

## Use Cases
This ToDo List should provide a userinterface, to manage todo's. It should be possible, to add new, and edit or delete existing todo's.
The attributes of a todo should be easily configurable. To have a good overview, the todo's should be sort- and searchable. Additinally there should be a calendar, where all todo's are marked.
A Todo List should be saveable in a local file (due to lack of time, this should happen with serialization!).

This ToDo List is designed for privat- or business use. Especially it is intended for persons who would like an organized and digitalized todo list.
