## Swingx

To compile the code in IntelliJ, you must have installed the SwingX API.
Download it from [Java-Webiste](https://java.net/downloads/swingx/releases/)(We used swingx-all-1.6.4.jar)

How to install SwingX in IntelliJ:

1. `File > Projectstructure > "+"-Symbol (bottom left) > JARs or directories > Select swingx-all-***.jar > Ok > Ok`
2. Your SwingX is ready to use
